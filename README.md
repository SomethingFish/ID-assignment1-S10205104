# My Personal Online Portfolio
This site that I have created for Assignment 1 is basically my portfolio, that showcases my who I am, what my skills are, what my aspirations are, any certifications that I have, and my contact number. This is made so that the target audience, my future employer, will be able to look at this information, as a consolidation of my experience and achievements gathered over the years, without having to look at a resume, instead in a more creative and personalised way.

## My Design Process
When designing the site, I wanted a simple but streamlined design, for the target audience to easily view the information. So I settled for a simple blue and while colour scheme, with imagery of what each page contains, in terms of information.
My wireframe in AdobeXD has a mockup of what I wanted it to look like.

## Features

### Existing Features
My site is very simple. There are 4 pages, the Introduction, or main page, Experience, which details my learning experience over the years, Achievements, which has all my important and less important certifications, and Contact Me, a page with my phone number and email address, for the future employer to take note of. There is a navigational bar at the top of the site, which leads to all 4 pages.

### Features Left to Implement
I would have liked to insert a way for the future employer to input their contact information, but I did not have the time.

## Technologies Used
I used AdobeXD for wireframing, and Visual Studio Code for creating the HTML and CSS files.

## Testing
The only testing was whether the links in the navigational bar would work. All the tests were successful in that aspect, and correctly directed the user to the respective pages.
